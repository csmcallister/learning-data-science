We had to pass our regular expression as a string because regular expressions aren’t a part of the core Python language. This keeps the Python language simpler for all other purposes, but creates a little headache when it comes to compiling the backslash character.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A quick note on escape characters and Python's raw string notation\n",
    "> Regular expressions use the backslash character (`\\`) to indicate special forms or to escape special characters. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals. For example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write `\\\\\\\\` as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be `\\\\`, and each backslash must be expressed as `\\\\` inside a regular Python string literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with `'r'`. So `r\"\\n\"` is a two-character string containing `'\\'` and `'n'`, while `\"\\n\"` is a one-character string containing a newline. **Thus it's best to type regular expression patterns  using this raw string notation.**\n",

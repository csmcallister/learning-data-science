    "We just saw how pickling converts a Python object (e.g. list) into a character stream containing all of the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another Python script. But why would you want to do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Constraints\n",
    "Sometimes you need to work with data that exceeds your computer's memory limits. If a scalable server isn't an option, you can use pickling to chunk up your data objects. In this way you do a little work on a portion of the data, pickle the output, do a little more work on another portion of the data, pickle that output, and so forth until you've covered all of the data. Then you can combine the pickled outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Networks\n",
    "Another use case is transmitting a Python object over a network. Normally, you would first need to convert the objet into a character stream before sending it over the connection. Pickling does that for you."
